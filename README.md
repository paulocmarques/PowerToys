## Installing and running Microsoft PowerToys

### Requirements

- Windows 11 or Windows 10 version 2004 (code name 20H1 / build number 19041) or newer.
- Our installer will install the following items:
   - [.NET 6.0.7 Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0#runtime-desktop-6.0.7) or a newer 6.0.x runtime.
   - [Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=2124703) bootstrapper. This will install the latest version.
   - [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170#visual-studio-2015-2017-2019-and-2022) installer. This will install one of the latest versions available.

### Via GitHub with EXE [Recommended]

 [Microsoft PowerToys GitHub releases page][github-release-link], click on `Assets` at the bottom to show the files available in the release. Please use the appropriate the PowerToys installer that matches your machine's architecture.  For most people, it is `x64`.
 
 - **For x64 processors (most common):** [PowerToysSetup-0.61.1-x64.exe](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/releases/download/v0.61.1/PowerToysSetup-0.61.1-x64.exe)
 - **For ARM64 processors:** [PowerToysSetup-0.61.1-arm64.exe](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/releases/download/v0.61.1/PowerToysSetup-0.61.1-arm64.exe)

This is our preferred method.

### Via Microsoft Store

Install from the [Microsoft Store's PowerToys page][microsoft-store-link]. You must be using the [new Microsoft Store](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsExperience/2021/06/24/building-a-new-open-microsoft-store-on-windows-11/) which will be available for both Windows 11 and Windows 10.

### Via WinGet (Preview)
Download PowerToys from [WinGet][winget-link]. To install PowerToys, run the following command from the command line / PowerShell:

```powershell
winget install Microsoft.PowerToys -s winget
```

### Other install methods

There are [community driven install methods](./doc/unofficialInstallMethods.md) such as Chocolatey and Scoop.  If these are your preferred install solutions, this will have the install instructions.

### FancyZones

- Fixed a bug that caused layouts to not be applied correctly when many monitors reported having the same serial number. (This was a hotfix for 0.60)
- Fixed a bug that caused layouts to not be applied correctly on some virtual monitor setups (This was a hotfix for 0.60)
- A "Rows" default layout is now applied to vertical monitors, instead of a "Columns" layout. Thanks [@augustkarlstedt](https://github.com/augustkarlstedt)!

### PowerToys Run

- Fixed a typo in the WindowWalker plugin UI. Thanks [@rohanrdy](https://github.com/rohanrdy)!

- The program plugin will now consider settings changed directly in ProgramPluginSettings.json. Thanks [@bezgumption](https://github.com/bezgumption)!

### Settings
